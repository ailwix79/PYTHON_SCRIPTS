[Verse 1]
I stay out too late
Got nothin' in my brain
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
I go on too many dates (Haha)
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin', "It's gonna be alright"

Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
